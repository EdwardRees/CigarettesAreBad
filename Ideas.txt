About: My name is Shreya Aghi, and I am an 8th grader in San Francisco. Earlier this year, I joined a local organization known as BACR which specializes in multiple community issues. One that specifically stood out to me is tobacco control. It’s a common fact that using tobacco products (such as cigarettes and vapes) is dangerous, but people often don’t know that tobacco use is the number 1 leading cause of preventable deaths in the United States. Additionally, most people suffering from tobacco addiction want to quit but don’t know and/or don’t have the resources to do that. The first step to tobacco cessation is understanding it’s importance and how it can be done, which is why I created (insert app name). (Insert app name) helps users learn about what tobacco is, the importance of eliminating it in communities, the health risks & dangers associated with it, and helps answer any questions one may have about tobacco control. Additionally, there are organizations and resources linked that further specialize in helping people quit or different initiatives to get involved. You can be apart of the solution, and it starts by opening the app.
